# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves migrating the existing Express.js (Node.js) backend to Bun runtime with Hono framework while maintaining complete behavior parity, API contracts, and improving performance. The migration will preserve all existing functionality including anime scraping, caching, routing, middleware, and static asset serving while leveraging Bun's superior startup time and performance characteristics.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate from Node.js/Express to Bun/Hono runtime, so that I can benefit from improved startup time and performance while maintaining identical API behavior.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL use Bun runtime instead of Node.js
2. WHEN any existing API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return identical response structure, status codes, and headers as the Express version
3. WHEN the application boots THEN the system SHALL start faster than the current Express implementation
4. IF any API contract changes occur THEN the system SHALL flag these as breaking changes requiring explicit approval

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Express routes converted to Hono equivalents, so that the API surface remains identical while using the new framework.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN converting routes THEN the system SHALL preserve exact URL patterns, HTTP methods, and parameter handling
2. WHEN processing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain identical query parameter parsing and validation
3. WHEN returning responses THEN the system SHALL use the same JSON structure and HTTP status codes
4. WHEN handling route parameters THEN the system SHALL extract and validate them identically to Express implementation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all Express middleware converted to Hono middleware, so that CORS, caching, logging, and error handling continue to work identically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CORS requests are made THEN the system SHALL apply identical CORS policies as the Express version
2. WHEN caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL maintain both server-side LRU cache and client-side cache headers
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return standardized error responses matching the current format
4. WHEN requests are logged THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent logging information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want static asset serving preserved, so that CSS, JavaScript, and HTML files continue to be served correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN static assets are requested THEN the system SHALL serve files from src/public directory
2. WHEN production builds run THEN the system SHALL serve minified assets via gulp pipeline
3. WHEN cache headers are set THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate caching policies for static content
4. WHEN asset paths are resolved THEN the system SHALL maintain current URL structure

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want web scraping functionality preserved, so that anime data extraction continues to work with axios and cheerio.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scraping anime sites THEN the system SHALL use axios for HTTP requests with identical headers and retry logic
2. WHEN parsing HTML THEN the system SHALL use cheerio with the same parsing logic
3. WHEN handling redirects THEN the system SHALL resolve final URLs using existing getFinalUrl logic
4. IF axios has compatibility issues with Bun THEN the system SHALL provide fallback options using undici or native fetch

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want TypeScript support and path aliases preserved, so that the codebase maintains strict typing and import resolution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the project THEN the system SHALL maintain strict TypeScript settings
2. WHEN resolving imports THEN the system SHALL support path aliases from tsconfig.json
3. WHEN running in development THEN the system SHALL provide hot reload functionality
4. WHEN type checking THEN the system SHALL enforce the same strict type rules as the Express version

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want build and deployment processes updated, so that Docker, CI/CD, and serverless deployment work with Bun.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building Docker images THEN the system SHALL use oven/bun base image
2. WHEN running npm scripts THEN the system SHALL use Bun equivalents (bun --hot, bun run, etc.)
3. WHEN deploying to production THEN the system SHALL support the same deployment targets
4. WHEN running tests THEN the system SHALL use bun test or compatible testing framework

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want request validation implemented, so that API inputs are properly validated with consistent error responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN invalid requests are received THEN the system SHALL return 400 status with detailed validation errors
2. WHEN validation schemas are defined THEN the system SHALL use Zod for type-safe validation
3. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return error responses matching the current error.ts helper format
4. WHEN valid requests are processed THEN the system SHALL pass validated data to controllers

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration and environment handling preserved, so that server settings and feature flags continue to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL validate environment variables using Zod schemas
2. WHEN configuration is accessed THEN the system SHALL use the same animeConfig.ts structure
3. WHEN feature flags are checked THEN the system SHALL respect href and sourceUrl toggles
4. WHEN environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want graceful shutdown and resource cleanup, so that the application handles termination signals properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SIGTERM or SIGINT signals are received THEN the system SHALL gracefully close server connections
2. WHEN shutting down THEN the system SHALL clean up any open resources and connections
3. WHEN cleanup completes THEN the system SHALL exit with appropriate status codes
4. WHEN shutdown takes too long THEN the system SHALL force exit after a reasonable timeout
